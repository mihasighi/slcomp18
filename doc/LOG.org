	. SHID_entl : 33 problems
     + v2/slrd-lm : 300 problems for divisions
	. SHID_entl : 31

     	. SHIDLIA_entl : 164 problems
	. QF_SHIDLIA_entl : 53 problems
   - [X] push bench from Songbird
   - [X] mine bench from Comp-SPEN
     + 22 problems in SL-COMP'14 format in QF_SLIDLIA_entl
     + 20 problems in SL-COMP'14 format in QF_SLIDLIA_sat
   - [X] push bench from Comp-SPEN
   - [X] push bench from Harrsh, >= 10 sat problems in qf_shid
     + dll: classic dll definition
     + dltree: cell similar to qf_shid_entl/tree-pp-*, different defs
     + lasso: sll cell xith lasso predicate, general ID
     + ncll: nested circular (1 item) lists
     + nll: nested lists like qf_shid_entl/nll_* but with nested list at nil
     + skl3: same as qf_shid_entl/skl3
     + sll-acyc: is ls0
     + sll-with-headptr.sid: sll with all cells pointing to some location (not compositional)
     + tll-acycl: like tll without aliasing except last next ref in the list inside the tree
     + tll-with-parent-ptr: exactly tll-pp
     + tll: aliasing allowed
     + tree*: possibly null binary trees
   - [X] pull bench from Le
     + qf_shid_entl: added 13 problems derived from existing ones (1 unsat, 12 sat)
     + qf_shid_sat: added 9 problems (all unsat)
     + qf_shlid_entl: added 13 problems, same as qf_shid_entl
   - [X] check the proposed benchmarks
     + Le's benchmark problems
       . qf_shid_entl/dll-vc14.smt2: inversed antecedent with consequent 
       . qf_shid_entl/nll-vc[17-19].smt2: not sure on status (missing distinct)
       . qf_shid_entl/skl2-vc07.smt2: not sure on status
       . qf_shid_entl/sll-vc01.smt2: why not in qf_shls_entl?
   - [X] check and push benchmark from CVC4
     + logic declared SEPLOGLIA for 74 problems but
     	- only 3 with 1 exists in consequent so even if check-sat the problem is no QF
	  . =dispose_manual/dispose-iter-3.smt2=
     	- only 24 with Int
	- 20 with wand and no nt
     + split over
       - qf_bsl_sat: 46
       - qf_bsllia_sat: 24
       - bsl_sat: 3
** Final situation: 1279 problems
  - execute bench/do-summary.sh
  - then press C-c + for column #problems
