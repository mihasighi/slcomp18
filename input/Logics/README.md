# SL-COMP'18 Logics #

These logics are supported by tools participating at SL-COMP'18:

For the theory **SepLogicTyped** (see file `../Theories/SepLogicTyped.smt2`):

* **`QF_SHLS`**: 
	closed quantifier-free formulas on symbolic heap fragment 
	with *list segment* predicate

* **`QF_SHID`**: 
	closed quantifier-free formulas on symbolic heap fragment 
	with *linear inductive definitions* 

* **`QF_SHLID`**: 
	closed quantifier-free formulas on symbolic heap fragment 
	with *general inductive definitions*

* **`SHID`**: 
	formulas on symbolic heap fragment with *general inductive definitions*


For the theory **SepLogic** (see file `../Theories/SepLogic.smt2`):

* **`SEPLOG`**: full logic
* **`SEPLOGLIA`**: full logic with linear integer constraints
